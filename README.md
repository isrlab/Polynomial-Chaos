# Polynomial-Chaos
This contains files for using polynomial-chaos theory to dynamical system design and analysis.
Folder matlab/ has code for MATLAB. This repository is not maintained. The MATLAB files should work for most "simple" PC problems.
Julia files are in folder julia/. 

For Julia, the package https://timueh.github.io/PolyChaos.jl/stable/ is recommended.
